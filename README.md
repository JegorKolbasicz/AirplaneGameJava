# ‚úàÔ∏è Airplane Game

A simple 2D **graphical** airplane game developed in Java. This project was a collaborative effort, focusing on fundamental game mechanics, object-oriented design, and basic user interaction within a dedicated game window.

## üß† Features

-   **Player-controlled airplane:** Navigate an airplane using keyboard inputs.
-   **Obstacle avoidance:** Dodge incoming obstacles to survive.
-   **Score tracking:** Keep track of your score based on survival time or objects avoided.
-   **Dynamic difficulty:** (Optional, if applicable - otherwise remove) Difficulty increases as the game progresses.
-   **Basic collision detection:** Handles interactions between the airplane and obstacles.
-   **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Game runs in a separate window, providing a visual experience.

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **Java** ‚Äì The core programming language.
-   **Java Swing / AWT** ‚Äì (Wstaw tutaj w≈Ça≈õciwƒÖ bibliotekƒô GUI, kt√≥rej u≈ºyli≈õcie. Je≈õli to by≈Ço co≈õ innego ni≈º Swing/AWT, zmie≈Ñ odpowiednio) ‚Äì For building the graphical user interface and handling drawing.
-   **Standard Java Libraries** ‚Äì For input/output, event handling, and game logic.
-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** ‚Äì Project structure based on classes representing game entities (e.g., `Airplane`, `Obstacle`, `GamePanel`, `GameFrame`).

## üöÄ How to Run

### üß™ Build & Run

To compile and run the game, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourGameRepoName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourGameRepoName.git) # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd YourGameRepoName # Navigate into the cloned directory
    ```

2.  **Image Placement:**
    **IMPORTANT:** Ensure all image files from the `pictures` folder are copied directly into the same directory as the `Project.java` file (e.g., `YourGameRepoName/Project.java`). The game expects these image assets to be in the root of the source directory for correct loading within the GUI.

3.  **Compile:**
    Compile the Java source file:
    ```bash
    javac Project.java
    ```

4.  **Run:**
    Execute the compiled game. A new game window should appear.
    ```bash
    java Project
    ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

-   Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
