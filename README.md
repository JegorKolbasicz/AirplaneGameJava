## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **Java** ‚Äì The core programming language.
-   **Java Swing / AWT** ‚Äì For building the graphical user interface and handling drawing.
-   **Standard Java Libraries** ‚Äì For input/output, event handling, and game logic.
-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** ‚Äì Project structure based on classes representing game entities (e.g., `Airplane`, `Obstacle`, `GamePanel`, `GameFrame`).

## üöÄ How to Run

### üß™ Build & Run

To compile and run the game, you will need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JegorKolbasicz/AirplaneGameJava
    cd AirplaneGameJava # Navigate into the cloned directory
    ```

2.  **Image Placement:**
    **IMPORTANT:** Ensure all image files from the `pictures` folder are copied directly into the same directory as the `Project.java`. The game expects these image assets to be in the root of the source directory for correct loading within the GUI.

3.  **Compile:**
    Compile the Java source file:
    ```bash
    javac Project.java
    ```

4.  **Run:**
    Execute the compiled game. A new game window should appear.
    ```bash
    java Project
    ```

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

-   Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
